To Do
Oh, and UNDO. All functions, command/control + Z. for everything, all shapes, restoring deleted

Why not just have an actual SVG paste to the identical place on the proceeding sheets after the main? 
Leave them the sane colour as now to know they are the 'slave', just make them movableetc.
Still leave the ability to draw new shapes at this stage.


Done
Is it possible to Paste on mouse pointer? Or am I stretching the friendship?


There is some funng stuff happening with the pasted SVG's not picking up the data correctly. Can you have a look? 
Some appear to be storing the data from the first drawn area. 
Not sure if it's me not double clicking and making them their colour and leaving the page when they're red?
Maybe worth having a failsafe script with the Extract button, 'make all coloured and not red/selected"?
